# Alternate
____
## What's this?
Just a webpage that embeds iframes and alternates between them (kind of like a slideshow made of webpages).

## If the project only contains a file, why does it have this readme file?
Because I just want to mention that I have coded this very quickly for the CÃ‰DILLE club, which I am a member of.

## How many bugs does it have?
Here are some known issues:
- Sometimes iframes refuse to load a webpage because of
	- CORS
	- the protocol specified in the URL isn't the same as the one with which you accessed the Alternate page
- Some webpages without any background color may show the other pages in the slideshow as background
